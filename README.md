## üëë Master Admin Setup

To gain full control over the application, you need to set up a Master Admin.

1.  **Sign Up**: Create a new user account in the application.
2.  **Get User ID**: Find the user's ID from your database in the `User` table.
3.  **Run the Script**: Execute the following command in your terminal, replacing `YOUR_USER_ID` with the ID you just found:
    ```bash
    node scripts/setup-master-admin.js YOUR_USER_ID
    ```
This will elevate the specified user to the `MASTER_ADMIN` role.
