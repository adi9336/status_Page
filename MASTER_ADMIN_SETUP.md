# Master Admin System Setup Guide

## Overview

The Master Admin system provides complete control over user management. Only users with the `MASTER_ADMIN` role can:
- Create new users
- Modify existing user roles and permissions
- Activate/deactivate users
- Access the Master Admin Panel

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your Clerk User ID

First, you need to find your Clerk user ID:

1. Go to your [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Navigate to Users
3. Find your user account
4. Copy the User ID (it looks like `user_2abc123def456...`)

### 2. Set Up Master Admin

Run the setup script with your Clerk user ID:

```bash
node scripts/setup-master-admin.js <your-clerk-user-id>
```

Example:
```bash
node scripts/setup-master-admin.js user_2abc123def456
```

### 3. Update Email (if needed)

If the script created a new user with a temporary email, update it in the database:

```sql
UPDATE "User" 
SET email = 'your-actual-email@example.com' 
WHERE role = 'MASTER_ADMIN' AND clerkId = 'your-clerk-user-id';
```

## Using the Master Admin System

### Accessing the Master Admin Panel

1. Sign in to your application
2. Navigate to Dashboard â†’ Users
3. If you have master admin privileges, you'll see a "Master Admin Panel" button
4. Click the button to open the full user management interface

### Master Admin Features

- Set initial permissions and preferences
- Users are created with `isActive: true` by default

#### Manage Existing Users
- Change user roles (except other Master Admins)
- Activate/deactivate users
- View user activity and creation dates

#### Role Hierarchy
1. **MASTER_ADMIN** - Full system control (cannot be modified by other users)
2. **SUPER_ADMIN** - High-level administrative access
3. **ADMIN** - Administrative access
4. **MANAGER** - Management-level access
5. **MEMBER** - Standard user access
6. **VIEWER** - Read-only access

### Security Features

- Master Admin users are protected from modification
- Role changes are logged and auditable

#### Database Validation

- Duplicate email/Clerk ID prevention
- Organization-scoped user management

## API Endpoints

### Master Admin Only Endpoints

- `GET /api/users/master-admin` - List all users
- `POST /api/users/master-admin` - Create new user
- `PUT /api/users/master-admin` - Update multiple users

### Regular User Endpoints

- `GET /api/users` - List users (filtered by permissions)
- `GET /api/users/[id]` - Get specific user
- `PATCH /api/users/[id]` - Update user (limited permissions)
- `DELETE /api/users/[id]` - Deactivate user (limited permissions)

## Troubleshooting

### "Access Denied" Error
- Ensure your user has the `MASTER_ADMIN` role
- Check that your user is active (`isActive: true`)
- Verify your Clerk user ID matches the database

### User Not Found in Database
- Run the setup script again with the correct Clerk user ID
- Check that the user exists in your Clerk organization
- Ensure the organization ID matches your setup

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify your `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Check that your database is accessible
- Ensure Prisma client is generated: `npx prisma generate`

## Best Practices

1. **Limit Master Admins**: Only assign the MASTER_ADMIN role to trusted individuals
2. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review user roles and permissions
3. **Secure Communication**: Share Clerk user IDs securely
4. **Backup**: Regularly backup your user database
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor user activity and access patterns
